## Ruby/Rails

- So far, it seems to me that if anything ever goes wrong in production and it's going right in staging, then the problem is almost definitely in your config/evironments, or in the ENV variables on your production server.
- Rails makes you think of tests in terms of **unit**, **integration**, and **feature** tests. Kent Beck's definition of levels of tests are: **unit**, **service** and **UI**, with **service** being tests that verify units of business value. It's also worth noting that in **unit** tests, the unit does not necessarily need to be one class - it could include a couple of classes too. Finally, **the ethos and goal of testing is more important than what category a particular test fits into**. Always ask "how well do my tests **isolate defects**, **verify behaviour**, and **provide me with design feedback**.
- In RSpec, you can check how long a set of tests (either one file or the whole suite) by doing `time rspec spec/my_class_spec.rb`.
- To create a test double in RSpec, you can do `my_double = double('my_double')`.
- To stub a method in RSpec, you can do `my_double.stub(:my_method).and_return(true)`.
- Although, I appreciate the creativity of abstract names and APIs for libraries, it can get very frustrating and seem unnecessarily complex. It's no surprise to me that beginner Rails developers don't know how build a basic Ruby app from the ground up when instead of `easy_web_fixture_creator` and `fixtures` in Rails, they work with the obscure `VCR` and `Cassettes`. It feels increasingly to me that as the number of these useful (but intentionally complex) increases, the likelyhood that Rails will organically grow to super-spaghetti framework proprotions seems inevitable. I feel sorry for Ruby most of all.
- I hit a bit of a brick wall when it came to [GistDoIt](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/gistdoit). For 0.1.0, I have decided to change the internals completely, and start again from a basic script. From there, I will take a birdseye view of the problem domain and think a little more clearly about my object graph and where I would like my seams for polymorphism to be. I've found, so far, that using TDDing as the only source of knowledge when it comes to designing a program is really difficult. It's still really nice to follow TDD whilst actually writing any code, but I find that I can quite easily make arbitrary design descions with TDD, and paint myself into a corner pretty quickly with an inflexible design. My steps this time will be:
  1. Basic script to understand the problem domain.
  2. Starting afresh with knowledge from the script, thinking about what obects exist in my system, and perhaps using cards to reveal this along with what messages are passed in the system and who is the sender and who is the receiver. The first time around, I got stuck with objects like Gist, GistFile, Github::UserConfig, Github::Client, CLI. I think focusing on the problem's domain and the vocabulary will help me define boundaries and responsibilities within the system better.
  3. Start test-driving a solution where I have a better idea of the problem domain and have well-defined objects, with well-defined boundaries.

## Erlang

- OTP (Open Telephony Protocol) is really misnamed - it might as well be something like Concurrent Systems Platform.
- Here's a good definition of **Concurrent** - **"Those things that donâ€™t have anything that forces them to happen in a specific order are said to be concurrent."**
- A process in Erlang is kind of like a person. None of the internal actions of a human - eating, sleeping, getting food poisoning - can affect the internal actions of another person. Only the messages passed between them can have external consequences.
- **A process in Erlang has its own working memory and its own mailbox for incoming messages.**
- A process in Erlang encapulates state.
- Erlang processes communicate with each other via message passing. The receiving process gets a copy of the data sent and nothing that the receiver does to that copy is observable by the sender.
- Most messages in Erlang are asynchronous. If you want a message to be synchronous, you have to wait for a response from the reciever to ensure that it has received it. Even then, you don't know what action the receiver has taken, so Erlang is best suited to asynchronous message passing.
- One of the differences of building an Erlang program is that you have to ask yourself "what activities here are concurrent (can happen independently of one another)?". Each one of these activities will be a separate process.
- `Destination ! Message` is the syntax for sending a message to a destination.
- When an exit signal is sent out by a process, all of the linked processes exit also (by default).
- One of the tenets of Erlang is "let it crash!" - it's okay to let the system fail and reboot it from a clean start.
- The concept of a `supervisor` in Erlang allows you to ringfence groups of process where all of the processes in the ringfence are guarded by a **System Process** which traps the exit signal and allows a sub-section of the program to be restarted without affecting other parts of the program.
- It's a command converntion to put an atom representing the type of data a tuple contains at the beginning of the tuple. For example `{countries, "France", "Scotland", "Italy"}`. These are called **tagged tuples**.
- From the outside, a **List** in Erlang is just an **Array** in Ruby. The big difference under the hood, though, is referential transparency. A list is just a singly linked list which always begins from an empty list. A list cell is built upon this, where a list cell two words in memory, where one word (on the left) is used to store the value or a pointer to the value of the 'item' and the other word (on the right) is used to point to the list cell in the list. In this way, the original list is never changed, because all you're doing is when adding a new item is pointing to the tail of the list. If someone else is using the tail, then it hasn't changed - they still have a reference to their head and tail, and you have a reference to your new head and your tail (which is the head of their list). Pretty cool.
- Lists must always **start with a pre-populated list or an empty list**. So, you can't do this `[1 | 2]`, but you can do this `[1, 2 | []]`.
- An important concept in Erlang is **referential transparency**. This basically means that you can guarantee that the value that a name refers to will never change.
- There are two types of calls to functions: local and remote. **Local** is when the function **appears in the same module that you're in**. **Remote** is when the function **appears in a different module**.
- If you want to make a remote function call, it takes the form of `module_name:function_name(params)`.
- Functions with an arity of 0 are called nullary. Functions with an arity of one are called unary. Functions with an arity of two are called binary. Functions with an arity of three are called ternary.
- An official function name (which isn't the same as the format used when calling it) takes the form `function_name/arity`. So, for example `lists:reverse/1`.
- Functions with the same name are only considered to be the same function if they have the same arity.
- Functions available by default (for example, those in the `erlang` module) are called **BIFs** (Built in Functions).
- There are 3 steps to actually having a running Erlang program:
  1. Write a source file
  2. Compile it
  3. Load it, or at least put it in the load path for automatic loading
- Here is an example of a basic Erlang program:

  ```erlang
  %% This is a simple Erlang module

  -module(my_module).
  -export([pie()/0]).

  pie() ->
    3.14.
  ```

- Firstly, `pie() -> 3.14.` is a **function definition**
- In Erlang, you can make an inline comment with `%` and a comment which takes up a line of its own usually starts with **%%**.
- The first item in a module (apart from comments) must always be the **module declaration** in the form `-module(...).`.
- **Declarations** are basically anything that's not a function or a comment.
- `-export(...)` is an export declaration. This is basically a way of defining the external API of the module. Only functions included here are available outside the module.
- When you compile a module (.erl), you produce a `.beam` file, which is also called an **object file**.
- You can complile a module in the shell by doing `c(...)`
- You can see the current **code path (same as $LOAD_PATH in Ruby)** by doing `code:get_path()` in the shell
- You can compile modules manually to a specific file by doing `erlc -o ./ebin my_module.erl`
- **Pattern matching** serves **three purposes**:
  - Choosing control flow branches
  - Performing variable assignments
  - Decomposing data structures

## Things I watched/listened to

- I read [Strategic vs. Tactical Descision Making](http://tinyletter.com/programming-beyond-practices/letters/strategic-vs-tactical-decision-making) by Gregory Brown. This is something that should really be omnipresent at the forefront of any developer's mind (especially beginners). Strategic thinking is important in the first instance because without having the ability to carefully consider the very general direction that your problem solving powers should be directed in, it doesn't matter how good your tactical decision making is. If you don't understand the basics of what TDD can help you achieve as a tactical decision, then all of the RSpec knowledge in the world won't do you any good.

- I read a blog post from 8th Light called [Git Disciplined](https://blog.8thlight.com/makis-otman/2015/07/08/git-disciplined.html). 
  - It talked about the importance of committing early and often. I think this is something I'd already learned the importance of myself by reading through a bunch of established Ruby projects from the first commit onwards. There was nothing worse than trying to look at a diff where 6 files which were reasonably unrelated had all been committed at the same time.
  - There are times when you absent-mindedly change 3 unrelated additions to a file at the same time, then you realize that you can't really get a clear commit message out of it. You sit there and wish that you could select the parts of the file that changed for one reason and commit the file in that state, and then apply the other changes in a new commit (without having to reset HEAD to an older commit and make the changes all over again whilst committing at the right times). Git provides a way to do this!
  - `git add -p file` puts you into interactive mode where you can choose parts of the file you want to add to the staging area. This means you can now bundle up associated pieces of files from different files into different commits.
  - `git reset -p file` works in a similar way, except that it works on files that have already been staged. So, you can remove the parts you don't want to commit, and then stage them afterwards in a new commit.
- I watched [Connascence Examined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQXVKHoUQxY) by Jim Weirich. This was fascinating, because connascence sums up a lot of 'principles' in programming in a single category - a category which contains many types. The basic idea of connascence is as a more scientific way to describe coupling. Things are said to be connascent when the grow or change together. For a simple example, a method definition (the name of the method when defined) is connascent with all of the places where the method is used - if you change one, you have to change the other. Connascence becomes more fascinating when it comes to things like passing in flags to methods, which then defines the control flow within that method - Jim defines this type of pattern as a form of Control Coupling.
