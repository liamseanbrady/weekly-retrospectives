## Ruby/Rails

- When refactoring, always remember to make a commit when you get back to green. This means that you can always backtrack to the most recent passing state if you go down a dead-end.
- Service and Domain objects are only really worthwhile when logic is repeated in two or more places inside the app, otherwise YAGNI.
- Public (API) methods should always be as cohesive as possible. This means that you should always be looking to get them on the same level of abstraction.
- Learned the **ord** method on strings in Ruby.

## Erlang

- **Records** are a way to model entities or object within a system in Erlang. A record is basically a fancy tuple and can be defined like so:
  ```erlang
  -record(customer, {name="anonymous", address, phone}).
  ```
The record declaration tells the compiler that you'll be working with a 4-tuples (3 fields plus the tag), where the first element is always the atom `customer`.
- You can create a record by doing:
  ```erlang
  #customer{name="Sandy Claws", address="Christmas Town", phone="55533344"}
  ```
  If you leave a 'field' blank, then will be matched to `undefined`.
- You cauld bind a record to the variable `MyRecord`, for example, and access the fields on that record by doing `MyRecord#customer.name`.  
- Modules are generally spit up into **Header**, **API**, **Behaviour Interface**, **Internal Functions**
  

## Things I watched/listened to

- [Why You Don't Get Mock Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9FOchgTtLM). 
  - 2 arguments against using mocks:
    1. They duplicate implementation code. If you change the implementation, you have to change the test and vice versa.
    2. They lead to brittle tests that do a poor job. 
  - **What is a Mock?** - a mock **asserts on messages** that go between objects.
  - **What is a Stub?** - a stub just **returns a value**.
  - It's a test smell when you set an expectation with a mock and also have an expectation on state at the end of a test as well. You should never really be asserting on interaction and state in the same test.
  - Two things that can improve your code:
    1. Follow the Tell, Don't Ask principle religiously. Don't ask objects about their state in order to make decisions.
    2. Hides internal state. Other objects shouldn't be able to 'get at' the internal state of an object. One way to ensure better encapsulation is to be aware of when you're purposefully exposing internal state to other objects, either via getters and setters, or via returning instance variable (@) values directly from a method (that's still a getter no matter what name it has). Returning `self` is one way to ensure that you block access to the internal state of an object - this is done in cases where the default return value of the method exposes internal state.
  - When you start trying to expose parts of the internal state of an object for testing purposes, this is definitely a test smell/code smell. You shouldn't be asserting on state in this case - you should just be asserting on interaction, and leaving the implementation of that module as the responsibility of that module. If you want to make sure that the system works as a whole, this is what integration/acceptance tests are for.
  - All of this makes perfect sense. **If the idea behind OOP is messaging, then the thing we should be testing is messaging, not state**.
  - Wanting to mock concrete objects is a design smell. What does this mean? Well, well-designed objects don't know explicitly who they're talking to. They should only know the **role** their collaborator is playing, not the concrete object which they're talking to.
  - In tests, you should always name collaborators by the roles they play, not the name of the concrete object.
  - Duplicating your production code in a test is a **test smell**.
  - **Don't mock boundary objects** - this means that we shouldn't mock objects we don't own like STDOUT or an external API. We shouldn't try to isolate behaviours that interact with objects past the boundary of our domain. Only integration tests **should test how our domain objects interact or integrate with things we don't own**.
  - Only mock peers, not internals.
  - **Don't mock boundary objects** - this means that we shouldn't mock objects we don't own like STDOUT or an external API. We shouldn't try to isolate behaviours that interact with objects past the boundary of our domain. Only integration tests **should test how our domain objects interact or integrate with things we don't own**.
  - Only mock peers, not internals. **You need to decide was is INSIDE and what is OUTSIDE your object**. In an object, not everything belongs to a peer (collaborator). Your domain object must actually contain domain logic. **Always, always always, when deciding what belongs in your object, ask the simple question: "is this my role as this object?"**.
  - If an object is an implementation detail internal to an object, then it doesn't need to be mocked or stubbed. If you start stubbing objects that are internal to another object, then tests become very brittle, because you're stubbing implementation details. Try to test code as a black box.
  - Tests should respect the encapsulation of your code. You should be able to test internal methods in an object as much as you want without having to change the tests.
  - Sometimes it is okay to do assertions on state. You just have to develop an intuition for when the correct times to do that are.
