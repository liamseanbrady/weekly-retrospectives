# Weekly Retrospectives

### What is the purpose of personal weekly retrospectives

This is where I keep track of things I've learned/reflected up during a particular week. I've found this to be extremely eductional so far, and also a good alternative to keeping a blog.

This also makes it easier for people interested in my development as a programmer can more easily understand what I'm learning at any particular moment, and help out in any way they see fit.

Finally, this is the best way I've found thus far to take responsibility for my long-term learning. I can reflect upon what I want to learn, what I've recently learned, and realize things that I didn't even know I didn't know (confusing, but true).

### Why this is better than a blog

For me, blog posts are best for teaching as a sole purpose. Sometimes writing a blog post can help solidify concepts for yourself too, but this has nothing to do with blogging - rather it has everything to do with getting your thoughts out of your head and reflecting on them.

Weekly retrospectives are quicker, more informal, and aimed specifically as personal development. And, they are also on Github, so people can read a retrospective like a blog post if they really want.
