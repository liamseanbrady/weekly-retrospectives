## Back on the Wagon

- Had a brief hiatus from explicitly taking time out of my day to keep my weekly retrospectives up-to-date. I've been getting very involved in the community and attended a 4 day hackathon which we won and have continued pursuing the idea, and plan to pitch for VC funding over the next couple of months.

## Normal Service Resuming

### Ruby and Rails

- Working on integrating Elasticsearch into a site. I'm not sure I like the idea of using the `elasticsearch-model` and `elasticsearch-rails` gems to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me, but it has allowed me to get started reasonably quickly and begin working on a basic understanding of how to implement more complex queries using the Elasticsearch Qeury DSL. In the future, I'd like to play around a little more with pure Elasticsearch queries and working closer to the metal.

### Elixir

- What is the different between `'hello'` and `"hello"` in Elixir?

- You can create your own **sigils** by defining a function in a module with `sigil_` and then any letter you want to use. For example

```elixir
def sigil_M(content, _opts) do
  IO.puts("Mmmmm #{content}")
end
```

- A good way to clean up code in modules (especially when reading from Application.get_env/2) is to use a module attribute:

```elixir
defmodule Encryptor do
  @prefix Application.get_env(:crypto, :prefix)

  def encrypt(text) do
    @prefix <> String.reverse(text)
  end
end
```

- Reversing a binary

```elixir

```

- How do you use the Macro.pipe/3 function in Elxir?????????????????

### Unix

- The following notes come from watching Ylan Segal's talk [Practical Unix for Ruby on Rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yptv5R5koeI)
  - `head` and `tail` can be used to show the start and end of a file. Passing the `-n` option can limit the number of lines shown. Passing the `-f` option makes the out live - so, if something is added onto the beginning or end of a file, then the output will show the update.

  - You can use grep with the option `--only-matching` (you can also use `-o`) to pass in a regexp and return only the text which matches the regexp. So, if we wanted to get only the text inside double quotes in a file, then we can do `cat file | grep --only-matching '".*"'`

  - You can simply use `sort` to sort input.

  - We can also use `uniq` to make sure the ouput is unique. This basically removes duplicates. If you pass `uniq` the `-c` option, this will also output a count of the number of times a line was present.

  - If in the string `'/users/3'` with `'/users/:id/'`, then we can used `sed` (which stands for **stream editor**).

    ```shell
    echo '/users/3' | sed -E 's/[[:digit:]]+/:id/'
    ```

   - You can constuct argument from input by using `xargs`. All you have to do is follow `xargs` with a command such as `gistdoit` and this will pass these arguments as arguments to that command.
